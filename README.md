This is the implementation of the tcp/ip stack, which was almost completely yanked from this source,
https://www.saminiir.com/lets-code-tcp-ip-stack-1-ethernet-arp (btw very good article for dummies like med )
with  a couple minor changes in the code.
This is generally the first project that was uploaded to github by me and written in C in Linux, I think I will continue to finish this mini project using the same guide, if you have any comments, and I'm sure there are a lot of them, please comment
